Accommodation finder web page (Tertiary assignment)

Made as an assignment learning how to use local javascript objects to return and search information via user paramaters, also featuring the google maps API.

Note to use this application properly you will require a google maps API key, which can be found here (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

To use locally clone this repo and navigate to the file (config - Copy.json) within the js file, rename as config.json and input your API key into '[{"key" : "YOUR_KEY_HERE"}]';
